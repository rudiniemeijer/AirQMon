# Air Quality Monitor
This repository holds all sources and documentation for what is called an Air Quality Monitor, which consists of a CO2 sensor, a cheap wifi-enabled microcontroller, and a LiPo battery. The Air Quality Monitor samples the air for CO2 values and sends a mean or modal value to a central database.
